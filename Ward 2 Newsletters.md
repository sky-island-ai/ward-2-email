### Paul's Note

I wanted to tell you a bit about The Homing Project. The Project looks to rapidly house individuals and families without housing. Their plan is to build a community of micro-homes on gated property with 24-hour security. The initial community will serve tenants who are younger than 25 or older than 50.

The community will share communal facilities like dining and laundry, and there will be services on-site run by partner non-profits.

The houses will be quick to assemble and can be disassembled if they are needed elsewhere.

There are 28 similar projects in California, and I look forward to the first one of these projects here. For more information, visit http://thehomingproject.org.

The Homing Project is having an event called Monsoon and Moonlight to raise community support. The event will be from 6 - 9 pm on July 26 at the Fourth Avenue Coalition office at 311 E 7th Street. The event will include food, music and an auction of donated items from local artists.

-

As part of our ongoing Better Streets program that voters approved, the city has begun work on the Rolling Ridge neighborhood. Those of you in the area may have already noticed crews out to do the initial tree trimming. Pavement preparation begins next week.

### Paul's Note

I want all of you to have a safe Fourth of July weekend. When you are planning how you will celebrate, please keep in mind that we have restrictions on fireworks within the City of Tucson.

Here is the word from the Tucson Police Department:

If you plan to use fireworks:

Only use legal fireworks purchased from a licensed vendor.
Keep fireworks away from dry grass and flammable materials.
Be considerate of neighbors, especially veterans and pet owners.
If it goes up or blows up, it’s not allowed.
Keep in mind that these restrictions are for personal safety and also because we are under drought conditions. If you are using legal fireworks, try to be mindful of neighbors that own dogs and those that might have medical conditions.

You can also enjoy one of the professionally done, public displays that will be put on all over town. These, by the way, are done with the permission and supervision of the Tucson Fire Department. Our display takes place over A Mountain and runs from 9 pm to 11 pm. The Tucson Convention Center parking lot will be open for you and your families.

Happy Birthday America!

-

One more quick note before you enjoy the weekend. We've been asked to remind those of you that recycle cardboard here to please break down your boxes. This leaves enough room for the next recycler.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

Understandably, I’ve heard from a lot of you about Project Blue. Many of you read about the County Board of Supervisors vote last week to sell a piece of land on the southeast side to a developer that wants to build a data center. This proposal, known as Project Blue, now falls into our lap as council members and it is likely to be the first of several such proposals.

I am watching this very closely. Any discussion about water in the desert is important and a discussion about users of large amounts of water is even more important. Right now, I am very skeptical about such an enterprise that uses that much water in our city and especially concerned that other large water users might be lining up to take advantage of our water resources. My other concern is the shroud of secrecy and lack of transparency with this project. Tucsonans deserve an open and honest conversation about how our water and energy resources are being used.

Tucson residents have worked hard over the last 40 years to conserve water for our future and I am, again, very skeptical. I would need a lot more specific information to even consider this request.

### PACC Pet of the Week

## June 20, 2025

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

As many of you have heard, my colleagues and I voted not to put a new Tucson Electric Power franchise agreement on the November ballot.

Most utilities have franchise agreements. These allow the utility to use the city right-of-way and access to the right-of-way for any repairs and maintenance. In return, cities ask for a small fee and maybe other conditions as well.

These agreements go to the voters and usually get renewed with not much fanfare. However, the renewal for TEP has been controversial. We asked for, and got, a number of conservation concessions for the agreement sent to voters in 2023, but that wasn’t enough for voters and well over half of you gave it a big no.

I understand why. It came on the heels of several rate increases and concerns over a transmission line project in midtown. While TEP could argue that these were not part of the franchise issue, it was one of the few ways for frustrated customers to make their views known.

Your council is frustrated too, and the discussion on Tuesday and the vote reflected that. As I said at the time, it doesn’t always feel like we have a good community partner in this franchise discussion. We are quickly moving up on the deadline for ballot language for a vote this November, and we haven’t received feedback from TEP on items we want in the next agreement.

Couple that with the news that came down on Tuesday that TEP is asking the Corporation Commission for a 14% rate increase. Setting aside the issues that the council have with this, it doesn’t seem that the company realizes that they are creating an environment that will make it difficult for the renewal to get voter support if we were to put it on the ballot this year.

TEP did not have a representative at our meeting even though the franchise agreement was on the agenda. They had a representative testify at the Board of Supervisors that morning for a rezoning that they are not directly involved in, but not for an item in front of the council that they say is necessary for their business. I have to wonder if they thought we would just pass it.

There is a small but substantial movement in town to make TEP into a public utility, much the way Tucson Water is. This has been an idea I’ve knocked around for a while, but I have always wondered how we could afford it. Things have changed. As I said at the council meeting, I’ve run the numbers and found how such a purchase could be financed. I’ve also been talking to people about the city running an alternative utility in some neighborhoods. If we as a community don’t think that things are working out with TEP, there are alternatives.

### PACC Pet of the Week

**FRUIT BAT**
ID# A830106

Age: 2 years old

Qualities: Gangly legs, the best overbite, huge ears, and a goofy personality: It's Fruit Bat! This pup endured a long shelter stay back in 2024 and recently returned to the shelter at no fault of his own. He is housebroken, crate-trained, and described as a big lap dog. Fruit Bat has done well with other dogs his size both in his previous home and here at the shelter. Although PACC staff and volunteers adore this guy, we'd love to make this stay a short one!

Fee: Fruit Bat is free to adopt. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped.

### Paul's Note

What a lot of people don’t know about the Emancipation Proclamation is that it didn’t have the force of law over much of the country where slavery was in force. Those states were in rebellion in 1863 and weren’t listening to much of what President Lincoln had to say. It took until union soldiers went into those states and occupied them before the freedom of African Americans would be recognized.

The last of those places was Texas, with the people of Galveston Bay being among the last to hear about the proclamation on June 19, 1865 when General Gordon Granger read an order freeing 250,000 slaves.

We celebrate this day as Juneteenth, which has been recognized as a federal holiday since 2021.

Here in Tucson, we have an annual Juneteenth Festival. This year's event is being held at Kino Sports Complex from 5 - 10 pm on Saturday. Organizers are promising food trucks, a kidzone and live music. Please come out and celebrate this important day in our history.

### Paul's Note

An ongoing project for my office has been preservation of the Fort Lowell Commissary (northwest corner of Craycroft and Fort Lowell Road) and the nearby Donaldson House.

The area is an important piece of Tucson’s Native, Mexican and Territorial history. The Commissary dates back to 1873, with local Mexican-American families taking over the property after Fort Lowell was decommissioned. Eventually, it was purchased by the Bolsius

Family. They added several new architectural elements, including some amazing wooden doors that you may remember that my staff and I personally worked on staining and preserving last year.

It’s been a long time coming, but we had a groundbreaking last Wednesday. Rehabilitation of the site was among the voter-approved projects in the 2018 bond package, but the project is also being helped along by a $300,000 grant from Arizona State Parks.

My office gets updates from JobPath, a program funded in part by the city that provides job training, as well as help for students that are currently in job training. It’s a program I’ve been proud to support for as long as I’ve been on the council.

They sent me a story about one of their students last week. This gives you a good idea of the sort of people we are helping.

Meet Tavares. Growing up in Yuma, surrounded by the Marine Corps and the Army, Tavares always knew he wanted to serve. At 20, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and his years in service gave him strength, purpose later in life—a new calling: healthcare.

Tavares became a Certified Nursing Assistant in 2007 and a Behavioral Health Technician in 2010, dedicating the next 15 years to Sonora Behavioral Health Hospital. But he always dreamed of becoming a nurse.

In 2022, he returned to school to pursue his Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) credential at Pima Community College and soon after joined JobPath.

Balancing full-time work, parenting two sons, and the demands of a rigorous program wasn’t easy. Tavares stumbled twice—once stepping away, once narrowly missing a pass—but he never gave up. He reapplied, restarted, and returned in January 2024.

JobPath helped Tavares with tuition and housing costs and Tavares also benefited from JobPath's partnership with Bayada Home Health. And this time he made it! His motivation? His sons.

“They truly would still love me if I hadn't kept up this goal,” he shared, “but now they’re proud of me. I’ve shown them you’re never too old to finish what you started—once or twice—if you want it bad enough.”

Tavares graduated from the LPN program last month and is studying to take his NCLEX-PN (the LPN licensing exam) this summer. His goal is to work with the VA Hospital. Tavares is a role model, and he's ready to serve again—this time in scrubs!

His success is a reflection of what’s possible when a community comes together to lift people up. From educators and mentors to advocates, funders, and neighbors—this is what shared impact looks like.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

There’s a lot of divisiveness out there, much of it stoked by people having a lack of the full picture.

I was taken to task in an op-ed piece critical of me and my staff in the Arizona Daily Star this week. Unfortunately, many of the complaints were, to be charitable, at odds with reality. Lucky for me, more than a few of you knew that it was not a complete picture of the facts and gave me and my office a chance to tell my side.

Op-ed pieces are often one-sided, that’s their purpose. That’s why it’s important for us to always seek out other sources of information.

-

My staff gets calls about people that let their dogs loose at public parks. It’s easy to dismiss this as people complaining because they don’t like dogs, but loose dogs, even ones that are otherwise well behaved, can cause problems for other park users, especially children, and other on-leash dogs. That’s why we don’t allow off-leash dogs in our parks except in designated dog parks.

It’s a frustrating call for my staff, since we don’t have a lot of tools to enforce these rules. We can make TPD aware of problem parks, but a lot of the enforcement of complaints is up to Pima County Animal Care Center’s Animal Protection Service.

The unit has 18 officers, and they cover the whole county. So far, they’ve had 1700 calls for service, 900 of those have been calls about off-leash animals.

However, it’s hard to respond to off-leash calls given the number of higher priority emergencies they also deal with. Add that to the size of the area that these officers are responsible for (there are seven states smaller than our county), and you can see how hard it is to get out to every off-leash call.

Steve Kozachik, my former colleague who now leads PACC, has come up with a low cost solution. He’s formed a volunteer unit to work with APS that educates park visitors about leash laws. They also hand out leashes, dog treats, information about the Pet Support Center and activity books for kids. They visited Jesse Owens and Udall Parks this past weekend.

They are looking for volunteers. If you are a dog lover that wants to talk to other dog lovers, or you just enjoy our parks, you can call 520-724-5998 Sunday-Wednesday or 520-724-5627 Wednesday-Saturday or email paccauxteam@gmail.com.

### PACC Pet of the Week

**PAWL**

ID# A865674

Age: 2 years

Qualities: Meet Pawl! This smiley boy is the resident PACC greeter pup and can often be found in the "Dog of the Day" yard as you first walk into the kennel area! Pawl came into PACC as a stray, but it's clear this guy has been a loved member of a family before; Pawl is housebroken, knows commands, and walks nicely on a leash. He's also a total lovebug with kids, older folks, and everyone in between.

Fee: Pawl is free to adopt. He is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped.

Contact: Pima Animal Care Center, 4000 N. Silverbell Rd., 520-724-5900. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 12pm - 7pm. Wednesday 1:30pm - 7pm. Saturday and Sunday 10am - 5pm.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

My note last week left an impression with a few people that I didn’t think that there was a place for law enforcement in our solution to homelessness.

The paragraph that a few of you took issue with was this one:

If we, as a community, decide to get tougher on drug possession and trespassing crimes, we have to remember that booking a suspect takes an officer off the streets for half a shift and we already pay millions in jail board costs, can we afford to pay more?

The reality is that the paperwork for these arrests does take officers off the street for a time,it can seem like a person can be booked and released with a trial date before the paperwork on the police side is even done.

If the argument is that more of these arrestees should be jailed for a time, it’s important to remember that this is not without cost to city taxpayers. Pima County charges us $495.94 to book an inmate and an additional $125.09 for each night they stay. Our recommended budget for next fiscal year already includes an additional $1.7 million to pay for jail boarding, an increase of 33%.

We could be more punitive, but there are those costs plus a major question of whether we have the capacity to keep all of these arrestees, even overnight. Also, and this is an issue I also addressed last week, treatment is not available for those with substance issues. When these people get released, and they will be released, they aren’t set up for new lives.

Law enforcement absolutely has a role to play. However, our police have to be part of a broader set of solutions that include providing treatment and services for people on the streets. This is not a problem we are going to arrest our way out of.

-

As of this writing, the Cody Fire near Oracle is well over 1000 acres and is only 5% contained. While this doesn’t directly affect Ward 2 residents, it is the result of long term drought conditions that are region wide.

The Pima County Board of Supervisors declared a fire emergency and that comes with a set of restrictions. These don’t apply in the city, but they are good to keep in mind, especially if you are planning to visit a county park or recreation area:

No open flames, including campfires, wood/charcoal grills. Gas grilling is allowed.
No shooting of a firearm, including target shooting, except at a developed shooting range or while engaged in a lawful hunt pursuant to state, federal, or tribal laws and regulations.
No use of consumer fireworks.
No spark-generating activities such as welding, unless essential and conducted with strict safety measures.
There are also fire restrictions in place on state and federal lands. Check with the appropriate agency before you go.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

We had another critical incident at a bus stop involving unsheltered people this week. This is the result of a series of different policies and national conditions that have created an environment that is frustrating and challenging.

We need to not be afraid to re-examine all of our policies but also to remember that policies have costs and often undesirable outcomes. Acting out of frustration without thinking through the outcomes isn't going to help either.

If we, as a community, decide to get tougher on drug possession and trespassing crimes, we have to remember that booking a suspect takes an officer off the streets for half a shift and we already pay millions in jail board costs, can we afford to pay more?

If the Mayor and Council were to enact a ban on camping in parks and washes, who is going to enforce it, how are we going to pay for it and where will those campers go?

While I think there needs to be a consideration of many local policies, we need to resist thinking that one particular policy change is some sort of magical solution. We have people in our community, for example, that think that restoring bus fares will erase a problem that has its roots in lack of housing, overstretched social services and easy availability of drugs. This is not a time for glib, social-media-ready slogans.

I get frustrated because I see policies that are out of control of our city leaders, but have a major effect on what happens on Tucson streets. For a long time, for example, I’ve been critical of the lack of in-custody drug treatment in our county jail. Our housing department and local non-profits get stymied building affordable housing because of delays at the federal level.

As policy makers, we need to consider these factors when coming up with solutions, but as local leaders, we need to resist the urge to pretend we lack any power to make things better. We need to figure out a way to facilitate better policies at other levels of government, or figure out how we can take up the slack ourselves.

As you know, my office has a staff member dedicated to homeless outreach. I visit camps with her frequently. Not all of our homeless population are addicts, but a significant number are. We make offers to get into services and they often refuse. Addiction clouds a person’s judgement: you actually think being on the street using is a better choice than sleeping in a comfortable room. Still, there are those moments of clarity, it might be an hour or two once a week. We need to make sure that when there are those moments that a bed in a treatment center is available. This would go a long way to solving our problem, and should be a priority.

I would also encourage you to report camps if you see them. The link is below. I know it can seem a little thing and people have expressed doubts about its effectiveness, but it’s important. It’s the best way for us to be able to respond.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

We are sad to report the passing of Paul’s father, Senator George Cunningham. All of us in the office knew and loved George and are mourning along with Paul and his family.
A memorial service will be held at the Jewish Community Center, 3800 E River Road, Monday at 1:30 pm. Our office will be closed that day so our staff can attend.

Paul wrote a tribute to his father on the occasion of his 80th birthday this past February. That is reprinted below.

Ward 2 Staff

My dad had one of the better runs as a public servant than anyone I can think of. He started that service early, as both an army reservist and as the assistant city manager of South Tucson while being a graduate student at the University of Arizona.

He also ran track at Catalina High School and has been a supporter of the program there ever since.

After his time at South Tucson, he moved on to work for the Arizona State Senate where he was the only person on staff for the members. He went on to be the lobbyist for his beloved University of Arizona. Eventually, he climbed the ladder to be a vice president there.

He didn’t deal with the academic side of things, but his work there was crucial to making sure that the learning environment was good for students, faculty and staff. He managed things like residential life and making sure that the roads on campus got paved.

In 1988, we had a governor impeached and Secretary of State Rose Mofford was elevated to our top office. Mofford had to staff up quickly and looked around for the most capable person she could think of to be her chief of staff. That was my dad.

After serving with Governor Mofford, my dad had decided, after years of working for and lobbying elected officials, to run for office himself. He came in second in a three way primary for house in 1992, which as we know is enough to get elected for that office. He served in Democratic leadership in the house and moved over to the State Senate in 1997.

His time in the legislature ended in 2001 and he had unsuccessful races for both congress and the corporation commission. Even so, he still found other ways to help improve Arizona.

He served as Governor Janet Napolitano’s budget director in her two terms. He also took some time to start the Grand Canyon Institute, a think tank which has had Democrats, Republicans and Independents on its board. The Institute serves as a counterweight to the myriad of special interest funded groups that try to keep pro-citizen policy goals out of the legislative conversation. It’s one of my father’s best contributions to our state’s civic life.

I learned a lot from my father about politics, policy and public service. I’m proud to have him as a father and happy I can carry on in his footsteps.

### PACC Pet of the Week

**SCOOP**

ID# A862408

Age: 3 years

Qualities: The family that scoops up this handsome boy is in for a lifelong treat. Scoop is a happy, playful boy who loves treats almost as much as he loves hanging out with people. According to PACC volunteers, Scoop is an expert at chasing the ball, but they’re still working to teach him how to bring it back.

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Paul Cunningham**
**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

Some of this newsletter was prepared for last week so we could discuss some of the distressing incidents in the city over the past month. In the interim, a couple of more incidents occurred and one of them was on the Eastside. First, I want to express my sympathies for the victims and their families. It is important that that we rally around these families in times like this. About a week ago, we had an incident involving middle school students at a bus stop on the Eastside. There have been multiple issues reported at bus stops throughout the community. This is unacceptable.

When a series of incidents like this occurs in the city, our first instinct is to point fingers and assign blame. I think it's really important that we take a step back and try to figure out what the real causes are rather than engage in arguments that lack research and analysis. As such, we need to take an inventory of our resources and challenges and make a holistic assessment of our public safety needs.

On one side, I get emails and phone calls every day that blame all crime in Tucson on our fare-free transit policy. They suggest that there was little crime in Tucson before this policy was initiated. It is hard for me to believe that the crime rate would automatically be reduced if we reinstated bus fares. I also get emails and phone calls demanding that my colleagues and I not even consider transit fares.

I’ve been on the city council for a long time and even when there is such radical disagreement between two camps in our city, they both have some valid points. At this point, we need to examine all options for making the bus more safe and secure. There is no evidence that would indicate that bringing back bus fares would lower the crime rate, but the bus needs more resources and I believe that the Mayor and Council need to at least discuss reinstating fares. At the crux of that discussion will be reinstating the previous fare structure from 2019 or adopting a newly constituted fare structure that makes more sense for Tucson.

I spoke with Chief Chad Kasmar and his team to gather some statistics and data for me. While they obtain some specific information; attached are the links to the FBI universal crime reporting database.

For historical data prior to 2020 click here. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019

For up to the year data click here. https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend

You will probably find (as I did) that gleaning conclusions from this site is an arduous task. What it will tell you though is that the crime rate seems to ebb and flow and that our crime rate is comparable to our peer cities. Though, it goes without saying we have had a very challenging last 6 weeks.

I think it’s important to recognize the work of the Tucson Police Department and their response to these major incidents. Our detectives and officers have been able to identify and/or apprehend suspects in all but one of these recent incidents. Most of them remain in custody. This is a credit to our police department. I think something that has helped was the expansion of the community service officer program. This allows our officers on patrol to respond to critical and violent incidents in a timely manner. Additionally, some of the work previously being done by police and fire is now being handled by social work agencies and city staff, further keeping more personnel available for more dangerous calls.

As a leader, it is my job to acknowledge that the last month has been challenging and address these challenges head on.

### Paul's Note

I worked as a probation officer before becoming a city council member and those of you who are long-time Tucsonans remember my grandmother, Lillian Fischer, was a judge that pushed for a lot of reforms when she was on the bench. My ears always perk up a little when I hear about new ideas for our court system and I’m always happy to see our city courts leading the way with innovative programs.

I heard from the city’s presiding magistrate, Hon. Jeffrey Klotz, that the Tucson City Court Community Court program received the Innovation Award from the Arizona Association of Treatment Court Professionals. Community Court is a collaborative effort between the Court, City Prosecutor, City Public Defender, and a variety of community-based providers to connect those in need with services such as housing applications, AHCCS, employment, substance and mental health treatment, court warrants and case resolution, and peer support. The intent of Tucson Community Court is to increase public safety through criminal justice and community collaboration.

Community Court is led by Judge Ryan Bleau and a team of dedicated staff members. For more information about Community Court, please follow the link:

Tucson Clean and Beautiful along with members of my staff (as well as your favorite city council member) cleaned up a wash near Speedway and Pantano.

I don’t think the wash has a name. It is not city property, nor is it owned by either the shopping center to the north or the HOA to its south. It’s been hard to track down an owner to get the thing properly maintained.

My office is trying to sort it out, but in the meantime it needs to be cleaned up. We brought in Tucson Clean and Beautiful and put the call out for volunteers to clean it up Friday morning. Thank you to everyone that showed up.

### Paul's Note

Sharon McDonough has been ably running our Public Safety Communications Department (PSCD). With the retirement of Chief Chuck Ryan, McDonough has taken the reins of our Fire Department. She was a skilled leader in our fire service before and I know she’ll be a great chief.

Her deputy, Mike Garcia, will now lead PSCD. He’s been part of briefings with my staff on the improvements and changes going on at that department for the last few years. He’s an able and knowledgeable leader and I look forward to working with him in his new position.

We all have a chance to celebrate the men and women that worked for Sharon and now work for Mike. April 13th - 19th is National Telecommunicators Week. Police and fire are very visible in our community and we have so many opportunities to thank them for their work. The people that answer the phones when we have to call 911 do their very important work almost anonymously.

National Telecommunicators Week is a chance for us to give them a thank you. You can visit the telecommunications center at 4004 S Park Avenue, Building 2, and you can bring them food, small gifts, notes or even just give them a thank you visit. They will appreciate it.

My staff and Tucson Clean and Beautiful will be cleaning up a wash next week and you are more than welcome to come out and help. The wash is located south of the Fry’s shopping center at Speedway and Pantano (7792 E Speedway), just north of the Casa Real neighborhood.

We’ll be working next Friday, April 18, from 8 am to 10 am. Bring a water bottle, wear close-toed shoes and we’ll supply the, as Arlo Guthrie would say, shovels and rakes and implements of destruction.

### PACC Pet of the Week

**FANTASMA**

ID# A852517

Age: 3 years old

Qualities: Since her arrival at PACC in October, sweet Fantasma has quickly won over the hearts of volunteers by being patient, gentle and friendly. Though she can be a little shy around new people at first, Fantasma takes treats gently, loves having her cheeks and chin petted and enjoys long, leisurely walks. She’s hoping to find a safe and secure home where she can decompress from the stresses of shelter life. She may benefit from living with a confident dog who could help bring her out of her shell.

Fee: Fantasma is free to adopt. She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped.

Contact: Pima Animal Care Center, 4000 N. Silverbell Rd., 520-724-5900. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 12pm - 7pm. Wednesday 1:30pm - 7pm. Saturday and Sunday 10am - 5pm.

### Paul's Note

My staff attended the Veterans Community Forum on Thursday that was put on by the Offices of Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego as well as the Veterans Medical Leadership Council and the Tucson VA Medical Center.

The focus of the forum was aging veterans, what one participant called the “Silver Tsunami”: aging Vietnam-era vets. People between the ages of 65-74 constitute the largest cohort of vets.

One speaker noted something familiar to me as both a councilmember and someone with a social work background: problems need to be addressed, in his word, “upstream.” Making sure that bills don’t get missed before they pile up; making sure that the car gets maintained before having to deal with a costly repair.

Luckily, there are a range of services for our vets, but many don’t know what is available and it can be confusing to navigate the number of federal, state and non-profit agencies. The State of Arizona has Veterans Benefits Counselors that can help. You can call them at 602-535-1215 or visit their webpage at https://dvs.az.gov/services/veteran-benefits-counselors-vbcs.

You can always call my office and we can find local veterans resources for you.

I’d like to congratulate the University of Arizona men’s wheelchair basketball team for bringing home a championship.

Last Saturday, the team faced off with the University of Texas-Arlington and defeated them 75-65 in the National Wheelchair Basketball Association’s Collegiate Division Championship, held in Illinois.

This was the third final the team had made but the first that they came out with a win. Thank you for continuing to doing us proud.

This past Monday was Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta Day, one that city employees get as a paid holiday. In past years on this day, my staff from Ward 2 and I have spent a few hours volunteering at Casa Maria soup kitchen. We did that again this year but we decided to take a step further and turn one day of service into a week of service. On Tuesday and Friday we drove around Ward 2 and rounded up abandoned shopping carts. On Wednesday, we joined some neighbors and spruced up their pocket park by painting a wall that has been plagued with graffiti in the past. And on Thursday we cleaned up a portion of the wash behind our office complex, picking up trash and removing buffelgrass. Take a look at these photos from some of the weeks' events.

As you know, my office and I have worked for the past 3 years to bring change to the Sun Van paratransit system which provides transport to our friends and neighbors who can’t ride the regular bus system due to a disability. Our work resulted in the Department of Transportation and Mobility commissioning a Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA) of Sun Van, which is the first time in its history that an analysis like this had been carried out.

As part of Sun Van’s outreach and public engagement surrounding the COA, they have published a short, 10 question survey which is open until May 9th,and can be found by clicking here.

I encourage you to share this with anyone you know who rides Sun Van or has a family member or friend that does because the results of this survey will shape the future of our paratransit system for years to come.

It is vital that as many Sun Van riders answer as possible because these results will directly shape the future of paratransit.

It’s stinknet season again.

Buffelgrass has been our most infamous, ecosystem-threatening invasive plant for many years now. However, it now has some serious competition in the form of a little yellow flower called stinknet. Stinknet typically blooms in March and April and this pungent annual is a triple threat of problems: it's highly flammable, can cause severe allergies, and outcompetes native plants. Last spring, in Casa Grande National Ruins National Monument, 70 miles northwest of Tucson, the stinknet infestation became so severe that the picnic area was closed to visitors due to health and safety concerns. While Maricopa and Pinal Counties have acres upon acres of desert taken over by stinknet, Pima County has been able to stave off such takeovers for now.

One reason is the outreach and mitigation work done by the Sonoran Desert Cooperative Weed Management Area — a group consisting of dozens of local organizations committed to fighting invasive species. The SD-CWMA has reached far into the community to encourage people to report stinknet sightings, and because of this, dozens of stinknet populations have been stopped before they had a chance to spread. Recognizing and reporting stinknet is a huge part of keeping our desert and our neighborhoods safe from this nasty, flammable invader. If you see stinknet, remove it immediately and then report the location on stinknet.org. It takes only a couple minutes and is invaluable for tracking the spread of stinknet in Southern Arizona. You can also check that website’s map to see if there is an infestation near you.

To learn more, view the online educational stinknet slideshow that the SD-CWMA created, and if you have any questions, contact Pima Extension invasive species outreach coordinator Ben Tully at bentully@arizona.edu.

I’m including a couple of photos of stinknet below to let you know what it looks like.

**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

The Palo Verde Park Neighborhood Association is hosting “MidCentury Celebrated,” a tour of homes in that neighborhood, on April 5.

The event is being done to highlight Tucson’s post-war architecture of ranch-style homes with large front and back yards. The homes in the neighborhood, between Broadway and 22nd Street and Wilmot and Kolb, were built in the 1950s and early 1960s. The original subdivisions that make up the neighborhood were Yale Estates, Miramonte Terrace, Glen Heather, Riviera Estates, Old Pueblo Estates and the evocatively named Mañana Vista.

The Star ran an article on the event that details the history and architecture of the area. It runs from 10 am - 2 pm and kicks off at Fountain of Life Church (710 S Kolb). It requires a $10 donation to the neighborhood association.

Remember that Monday is Tucson’s observance of the César Chávez and Dolores Huerta Holiday. All City of Tucson offices, except for emergency services, will be closed. All trash and recycling collections will remain on schedule, so make sure to roll out your bins as usual. The Los Reales Sustainability Campus and landfill services will be open on Monday, and all public transportation will be on a regular schedule.

My staff will be doing a day of service at the Casa Maria Soup Kitchen to celebrate César's and Dolores's legacy.

### Paul's Note

Over the last few years, I’ve become very attuned to the issues facing the disability community. I’ve mentioned before that several members of my staff have disabilities, and they’ve given me a much needed education in how our city government could do a better job of including their needs when decisions get made.

Being an elected official also gives me a chance to let you know about events in town that highlight our disabled community.

The great folks at Paralyzed Veterans of America are currently running a campaign called “Honor the Spot,” which is a pledge that can be filled out online to honor the spot and save the accessible parking spot for people who need it the most.

This parking provision, established by the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, is often abused by able-bodied folks who want to park as close to the entrance to a store or office building as possible. These spots are for the disabled who have to display either a placard on the dashboard or a license plate with the universal sign for disability on it and individuals need to submit proof of disability during the application process.

I urge you all to take the pledge to “Honor the Spot: by following this link:

The conference will be a mix of interactive workshops, research presentations, personal narratives, and visual art submissions from our University students, staff, and faculty as well as community presenters from Tucson and Southern Arizona. Attendees will leave the conference with increased knowledge on:

Emerging topics in Disability Studies
First-person narratives on navigating ableism and inaccessibility
Best practices for accessibility in education, medicine, and the workplace
Disability activism on the individual, community, and government level.
You can now register to attend in-person or online through the registration link.

### Paul's Note

I’m on vacation with my family this week, but I need to say a few things about Raúl Grijalva, who passed away Thursday after a battle with cancer.

My sincerest condolences to his wife Mona and his daughters Raquel, Marisa and Adelita. Thank you for sharing Raúl with the rest of us.

It’s difficult to imagine what our local politics will look like without Raúl, mostly because he’s been a presence in local office for so long. It’s not just that he held public office, a lot of people have done that but didn’t have nearly the impact or presence that he had. It was because he saw himself as an advocate, a force of nature on issues ranging from labor to environment to civil rights. He was the real deal, and you knew it when you shared a room with him.

He was a quintessential Tucsonan. His parents came here as part of the Bracero Program and worked the Canoa Ranch. He graduated from Sunnyside High School and was a fixture in Chicano activism before making a run for the school board. Eventually, he got elected to the Board of Supervisors and navigated Pima County Government through some rough times. That whole time, he was Raúl: a fighter for the working person and others who didn’t end up on the radar of a lot of politicos at that time.

He made it to congress and could often be seen on the floor wearing a bolo tie while speaking on behalf of everything from LGTBQ+ rights to conservation. Truly Tucsonan.

He rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because of his stances and he didn’t fit the generic image of a congressman. Still, he got re-elected over and over again by pretty sizeable margins. He was doing something right: representing his constituents with a quiet ferocity.

He’ll be missed by all of us here at the Ward 2 office. Gracias, Raúl.

**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

Last fall, there was an unfortunate incident in Ward 2 when a large group of unruly people descended on Claire Weeks Terra del Sol Park. An earlier altercation in another part of town somehow spilled over into the park and a shooting broke out with more than 80 bullets fired. Miraculously, no one was killed and there was only one minor injury. However, emotional trauma for the neighbors and many children who use the park daily was left behind. My thanks to our amazing TPD officers who responded, many of whom stayed late into the night with some of the nearby residents offering support.

A few weeks after the incident, our office was contacted by a former colleague of mine, who I used to teach with at Apollo Middle School. Jen Warnstedt and many of her family members live in the Terra del Sol neighborhood and use the park quite often. She had an idea to help the neighborhood kids work through their trauma and feel comfortable in the park once again; to repaint some of the picnic tables and benches in the park and have the kids paint their handprints onto the tables. This would be a fun way of allowing the kids to get reconnected to their neighborhood park.

This past Friday, it all came together and more than 30 kids showed up with their families for this great event. The Tucson Parks and Rec department provided the paint, our office brought painting supplies, Pizza and Eegees, and Jen and her family brought cupcakes and drinks and helped get the kids and families there. We even had a couple of art students from Palo Verde High School show up to help paint the kids' hands before they made their mark on the tables. My thanks to everyone involved in making this event a success and a fun way to heal in one of our great Ward 2 parks.

**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

Sunday, we celebrate the 80th birthday of my father, Senator George Cunningham.

My dad had one of the better runs as a public servant than anyone I can think of. He started that service early, as both an army reservist and as the assistant city manager of South Tucson while being a graduate student at the University of Arizona.

He also ran track at Catalina High School and has been a supporter of the program there ever since.

After his time at South Tucson, he moved on to work for the Arizona State Senate where he was the only person on staff for the members. He went on to be the lobbyist for his beloved University of Arizona. Eventually, he climbed the ladder to be a vice president there.

He didn’t deal with the academic side of things, but his work there was crucial to making sure that the learning environment was good for students, faculty and staff. He managed things like residential life and making sure that the roads on campus got paved.

In 1988, we had a governor impeached and Secretary of State Rose Mofford was elevated to our top office. Mofford had to staff up quickly and looked around for the most capable person she could think of to be her chief of staff. That was my dad.

After serving with Governor Mofford, my dad had decided, after years of working for and lobbying elected officials, to run for office himself. He came in second in a three way primary for house in 1992, which as we know is enough to get elected for that office. He served in Democratic leadership in the house and moved over to the State Senate in 1997.

His time in the legislature ended in 2001 and he had unsuccessful races for both congress and the corporation commission. Even so, he still found other ways to help improve Arizona.

He served as Governor Janet Napolitano’s budget director in her two terms. He also took some time to start the Grand Canyon Institute, a think tank which has had Democrats, Republicans and Independents on its board. The Institute serves as a counterweight to the myriad of special interest funded groups that try to keep pro-citizen policy goals out of the legislative conversation. It’s one of my father’s best contributions to our state’s civic life.

I learned a lot from my father about politics, policy and public service. I’m proud to have him as a father and happy I can carry on in his footsteps.

### Paul's Note

It’s Valentine’s Day for the rest of the country, most of the rest of the world, really. But here in Arizona, it’s also Statehood Day.

We gained statehood after a half century of being a territory, one of the longest times any current state had been given to incubate before being allowed to join the big league. The objections to giving Arizona statehood were many, and most would, we hope, not fly today. Those rather objectionable objections included that there were too many Native Americans, too many Hispanics and a worry that Mormons who had taken refuge in Mexico would return to settle in the newly minted state and stage a takeover.

When those objections were overcome, statehood was signed into law along with that for neighboring New Mexico. Our “five c's” that drove our state’s economy were already well established: copper, cattle, cotton, citrus and climate. Yes, even the last one. We had our first “wellness resort,” built at Castle Hot Springs north of Phoenix in 1896, with Tucson’s own Agua Caliente coming soon after. The country was experiencing a boom at the time in what was called “heliotherapy” with local sanitoriums offering our sunny days to people around the country as cures for disease.

As for copper, a 1909 estimate said that 81% of the Arizona economic value came from copper mining.

The census in 1910 didn’t break down the number of Hispanics in what was then Arizona Territory, but found 51,102 Mexican born residents among our foreign born population, with an additional 20,650 citizens with one or both parents born in Mexico. You add that to whatever the uncounted American-born Hispanic population that had roots going back a century and a half, and you have a significant slice of Arizona’s 204,854 people at the time of statehood.

Native American population, listed in that census as “Indian,” was 29,201. They were, it should be noted, largely banned from voting here until 1948.

Despite the large Hispanic presence in the population and the fact that they dominated the legislature only two generations before, there was a grand total of one Hispanic on the committee that wrote our state’s constitution. He (they were all men) had a last name that will be familiar to long time Tucsonans: Carl Jácome.

The constitution was regarded as quite progressive at the time and it caused issues for president William Howard Taft. It included provisions like recalling elected officials, voter sponsored initiatives and women’s suffrage. Many of these were razored out to get statehood approved, then promptly re-added by voters when they had their first chance.

The largest cities in the new state were, no surprise, Phoenix and Tucson, although it’s worth noting that the Old Pueblo was a bit bigger than the Valley of the Sun at the time. The third largest city was, and this might surprise some of you, Bisbee. Bisbee, Douglas and Globe were metropolises by Arizona standards at the time, which says a lot about how dominant the mining industry was in our state. Mining is still very important, but technology means it isn’t as much of an employment opportunity as it was a century ago.

My family arrived here in the 1950s as part of Arizona’s post-World War II boom and I’m proud to be an Arizonan. We’ve got a really beautiful place to live. I’m hoping we can continue to make this state better, and more importantly, something that can be sustained for future generations. Happy Valentine’s Day, Arizona.

I, along with more than 300 other volunteers from our community, volunteered for our city’s PIT count on January 29th.

The “Point in Time” count is an annual assessment of the number of unsheltered people in our community, along with those who are in emergency shelters and other facilities. This count is required by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, but it’s left up to local communities to figure out how to best organize it.

The data is still being compiled and when it’s complete, it will be a way for HUD, City of Tucson, Pima County and other agencies in our region to know the best way to allocate resources. This year’s count was divided into 40 sectors that covered the area from the northern edge of Pima County to Los Reales Road. This year it also covered both the communities of Catalina and Ajo for the first time. The need to include these communities is a sign of how pervasive homelessness has become nationwide.

My group visited with 93 people. We not only made a count, but interviewed people. We heard their stories. Some were people who had serious mental health or drug issues, but we also met people who had jobs but couldn’t either afford or find a decent place to live. Through the work I’ve done in my office, I think I’ve had a good understanding of what people on the streets go through. Still, it was important to have a chance to be out there and talk to them.

I took the volunteers in my group out to lunch after, but I wish I could thank all of the volunteers. This was important work and will help us find more useful decisions going forward.

Esperanza Dance Project, founded 2011 in Tucson by Beth Braun, is a community-based collaboration that uses dance performances to educate about the issue of childhood sexual trauma and deliver a message of hope, strength and empowerment. Esperanza Dance Project welcomes community advocates and allies to come together and join One Billion Rising, happening 2/14/15 on the UA Mall at 4:30pm, a global day of action to end gender-based violence. To learn more about Esperanza Dance Project visit their website at: https://www.esperanzadanceproject.org/

One Billion Rising is the biggest mass action to end violence against women (along with marginalized identities that are subject to gender-based violence) in human history. The campaign, which launched on Valentine’s Day 2012, began as a call to action based on the staggering statistic that 1 in 3 women on the planet will experience gender-based violence during her lifetime. With the world population at 7 billion, this adds up to more than ONE BILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS. You can learn more about One Billion Rising at onebillionrising.org

**Paul Cunningham's Weekly Update**

**Tucson City Council, Ward 2**

### Paul's Note

There’s been a lot of news about the President’s executive orders and concern about the scaling back of protections for many communities in our country.

There is one protection that has been rolled back that I would like to shine a spotlight on. It may not seem a big deal, but the federal government is no longer going to require web and app accessibility for folks who may need to use a screen reader or other assistive technology to access content online through a web browser or cell phone app. Even folks who may like to use some of the accessibility features on a web site such as enlarging text or changing a website’s color scheme to make it easier on the eyes to read will not be able to do so any more. As many of you know, I have a staffer in my office that would be unable to do his job if it wasn’t for this technology.

Think about this: maybe you have a family member going to college with a visual impairment or maybe a learning disability. Without these requirements in place, that student would be unable to adequately access the websites and databases required for any classroom work that involves federally funded research or government data.

As a classroom teacher, I can tell you that even at the elementary and high school level, there are many parts of the curriculum that now rely on internet access. I have had students that would have had a rough time if not for access standards that are guided by those at the federal level.

This goes beyond making accessing federal programs more difficult for the visually impaired. Late last week, the administration took unprecedented steps to dismantle accessibility initiatives across the federal government and beyond. The president signed executive orders eliminating federal accessibility programs, putting accessibility staff on administrative leave and targeting accessibility policies at colleges and universities. After years of progress, the rights of the disabled are now under direct threat.

In the future, this could mean that when you make a visit to a local congressional office to check on your social security payment, that location might not be accessible if you have a disability. It could mean that a program that helps a person with a disability pay for a service or equipment that allows them to be in the workforce no longer exists.

One thing that needs to be considered when we think of these issues is that, if we are blessed to have long lives, we will all have a disability of some sort at some point. In the future, maybe our eyesight will fail a bit, maybe we won’t get around as well. This affects all of us.

I am tracking this issue very closely and will make sure that my colleagues on the council take any and all steps to ensure the city’s websites, dashboards and apps are made accessible for all, and continue to ensure that city facilities and services are available to everyone no matter their physical ability.

I heard from Sheila Bowden of the Friends of Fort Lowell Park. I wanted to give them a shout out for their work day at the park last Saturday. Here is what she sent my office about the event:

Saturday's Work Event was staffed with 7 amazingly dedicated volunteers! The temperature was very cold, which likely impacted our turnout, but all in attendance came prepared for 32°. Once we started moving, it seems everyone forgot about the chill. Our major accomplishments of the event were:

building up dirt "wells" around the base of 8 trees to help keep irrigation water in place
filling duck huts with dried leaves to provide some padding and insulation from the cold bare ground
repairing the gate in the ocotillo fence
picking up trash
minor trimming of branches
What a great day!

Photos, courtesy of Sheila and Redflower, are below. They have another event scheduled on February 8. If you would like to join in or find more information, email at friendsoffortlowellpark@gmail.com.
